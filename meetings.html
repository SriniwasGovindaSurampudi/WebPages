					<dt><b> Interpreting π's </b></dt>
					<dd>
						π's have almost full rank, i.e. if num_regions = 68, then rank is 67.
						<br> There are two views, but none has a strong support from cognition point of view.
						<ul>
							<li>A column of π can be interpreted as a pattern of co-activation of regions. Every column of π is an independent co-activation pattern. But this meaning as 'co-activations' has to be well understood.
							<br> (One link - modulation)</li>
							<li>According to Ashish Raj's paper, they call a column as initial configuaraion of regional activations. For jth column only region j is active. Hence, is this meaning is extended, jth column of π is a new representation of region j, but this representation is independent but not orthogonal!</li>
						</ul>
					</dd>
					<dt><b>community detection</b></dt>
					<dd>before understanding π's well, to get some initial results, communities found at every scale can be studied. applied louvian community detection algorithm on FC_i, FC at each scale and found communities.</dd>
					<dt><b>Data collection for further projects</b></dt>
					<dd>1000 data samples need to be collected from Human Cnnectome Project</dd>
					<dt><b>Deadline for this paper submission</b>/dt>
					<dd>to boost up speed, it is tentative to finish up this paper by 2nd October, before Dussera holiday.</dd>

					<dt><b>Interpreting π's</b></dt>
					<dd>We are going with the interpretation as follows: 
						<ul>
							<li>Diffusion kernels capture correlations of BOLD signals between every pair of regions</li>
							<li>π at a scale, captures the modulation effect between all regions.</li>
						</ul>
					</dd>
					<dt><b>Linking MKL model with the differential equations</b></dt>
					<dd>Till now only MKL model's final form is giving results, but it needs to be linked to the differential equations which when solved take MKL form. For tihis, Ashish Raj's differential equation was taken forwrd, but mathematics needs to done properly yet (intuition anticipates a solution). Or need to come up with another explanation.</dd>
				</dl>
				<dt><b>Experiments</b></dt>
				<dd>
					Differential equation setting is independent of further analysis of π's. Hence,  
					<ul>
						<li>to see Pearson correlation between FC_{i} (= K_{i} * π_{i}) and FC_{emp} and SC_{emp}</li>
						<li>Compare π's for 68 and 188 regions whether similar regions are modulating in the both datasets.</li>
