			<td>A Tutorial on Spectral Clustering</td>
			<td>Three tyes of graph laplacians, unnormalized, random walk and symmetric graph laplacians, and their properties are described. Their related spectral clustering algorithms are derived from scratch from several different approaches viz graph-cuts, random-walk and perturbation theory point of views.</td>

			<td>Laplacian Eigenmaps for Dimensionality Reduction and Data Representation</td>
			<td>This paper deals with the problem of appropriate representation of data lying on a low dimensional manifold, which is in a higher dimensional space. The paper shows correspondences between the proposed method and Laplace Beltrami operator on manifolds  and connects with the heat equation. The geometrically motivated algorithm is an efficient approach for nonlinear dimensionality reduction. This algorithm uses the eigen values and eigen vectors of graph Laplacian. This is very much related to spectral clustering algorithm, just that the eigen vectors are used as bases for the embedding to reduce dimensionality of data.</td>

			<td>Network diffusion accurately models the relationship between structural and functional brain connectivity networks</td>
			<td>This paper hypothesises that diffusion of signals on structural connection of the brain network can predict functinoal connectivity. Considering only one ROI actice at a time, the activation signals reaching its neighbor ROIs, through diffusion, at any given time is hypothesised as the pairwise correlation between these ROIs. These individually and independently active ROI activation diffusions are stacked together and hypothesised that the overall functional correlaton matrix can match at a particular scale.</td>

			<td>Machine learning with brain graphs: predictive modeling approaches for functional imaging in systems neuroscience</td>

			<td>The UCLA multimodal connectivity database: a web-based platform for brain connectivity matrix sharing and analysis</td>
			<td>This paper mentions about the <a href="http://umcd.humanconnectomeproject.org" target="_blank">website</a> for accessing and analysing various structural and functional matrices, which are publically available. To demonstrate the site’s functionality, whole brain functional and structural connectivity matrices are derived from 60 subjects’ (ages 26–45) resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) and dwMRI data and uploaded to the site. Graph theoretical properties can be applied on the connectivity matrices to infer about global and local properties. Functional connectivity matrices are derived from resting state fMRI, dwMRI, and structural connectivity matrices are derived from DTI, MRI methods.</td>
